## Story machine
So, there are plenty of online tools which allow you to manage user stories for use in a scrum environment and many of them are very good. But I don't want to manage sprints with one of these tools. I like 'big visible charts' and, unless you've got a projector on all the time, the online tools aren't visible enough.

This is why I created the story machine. It affords you the convenience of using a tool to manage your stories in many states, estimate, plan etc etc without having the temptation of using the tool to run sprints too.

## Status
As the moment, it's in very early beta and doesn't even work.

## Licence
Whatever, feel free to do what you want with it. It's based on codeigniter, so you'll have to use their licence too I guess. Just let me know if you do anything with it!
